	<title>Welcome to Maria Emilia Lasso de la Vega's Website</title>

    My name is Maria Emilia Lasso de la Vega, but my friends call me Emilia or Emily since it is shorter. I have always had an interest in web development and took courses in my undergrad related to design principles, interaction design, and others. However, the last time I took an actual HTML class was when I was in middle school, which means I learned <i>HTML4</i>, but that has not stopped me from updating websites with some help from the all-mighty Google. I chose to take this course to refresh my HTML knowledge and learn more about CSS since I have not taken any courses that cover CSS specifically. With these newly acquired skills, I hope to be able to produce some professional-looking web pages and continue editing as needed.

	Some of my hobbies: digital art, arts and crafts, cooking, being a couch potato, and tap dancing.
