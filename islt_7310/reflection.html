        <p class="reflection" id="ref_first">Throughout my journey as a graduate student, I found myself wondering what I can do to change the world for those who are underserved. Technology is no longer a commodity. It is a necessity. However, technology is perceived as a luxury and it is priced as such. The 2020 pandemic truly highlighted the inequalities of this world and showed us that the only way we could continue educating our young was through the use of technology. While a lot of students were able to continue their studies online without any issues, there were many students left behind due to several reasons and accessibility was one of the main issues. </p>

        <p class="reflection">The competencies, goals, and objectives of the Learning Technologies and Design degree program align with my personal goals and dream to create a world where education is accessible to all. Through research, we can create innovative systems and platforms that serve all types of populations (Design and Development of Learning Systems). We can explore current opportunities, systems, and technologies, and upgrade them so they can be utilized in different manners (Front-End Analysis and System Evaluation). Lastly, as professionals, we can recognize the need and provide the assistance to support those who are underrepresented and underserved (Leadership and Social Responsibility). </p>
