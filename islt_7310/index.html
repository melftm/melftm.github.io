    <p>I am a current student at the University of Missouri pursuing a Master of Science in Learning Technologies and Design, and I expect to complete my studies in the fall of 2021. Currently, I work with Missouri University of Science and Technology in the department of Student Diversity Initiatives. I hope that this degree can provide me with more insight to develop research backed training opportunities to tackle current global needs and provide new educational opportunities to underserved populations. The purpose of this portfolio is to show understanding and mastery of the Learning Technologies and Design competencies: Design and Development of Learning Systems, Front-End Analysis and System Evaluation, and Leadership and Social Responsibility.</p>
