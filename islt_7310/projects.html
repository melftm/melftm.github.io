                    <h4>Design and Development of Learning Systems</h4>

                    <p>Group project in which we design a webinar to educate adults in rural Missouri on the topic of Type 2 Diabetes and how physical activity improves the condition. The project includes broad goals and ideas, learning outcomes, needs assessment, task analysis, evaluation, and implementation plan. Lasso de la Vega was in charge of gathering content and organizing the final draft, creating materials necessary for the webinar, creating learning objectives, and evaluation.
                    <br><br>Strengths: Comprehensive project that includes a lot of detail on the back end and puts a lot of research on the content.
                    <br><br>Weaknesses: Not as much effort was put on the implementation phase and no facilitation training guides were created.</p>

                    <h4>Front-End Analysis and System</h4>

                    <p>When I started my position at Missouri University of Science and Technology, I was tasked with updating an educational workshop that is presented to all incoming freshmen. This workshop had been originally put together rather quickly and by piecing together older presentations and workshops. This is the second year in a row where I have spent time updating and redirecting the workshop to meet the needs of the audience. With a team of two other experts, this year we have created a presentation grounded in theory with meaningful learning objectives and assessment strategies to engage the audience.
                    <br><br>Strengths: The workshop continues to improve and the activities created reflect the values of the institution while also encouraging self-reflection among the audience.
                    <br><br>Weaknesses: The presentation is tied to the values the university has created, which constricts the message of the training. The main purpose of the training is to educate the incoming class on topics of diversity and inclusion, but not all the values correlate to this message in a seamless way. </p>

This project entails creating modules to and assessment strategies to ensure that employees in a law firm in Panama understand the policies in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19 once they return to their offices.
